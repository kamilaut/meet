# Meet App

A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) using React and a test-driven development (TDD) approach. The application utilizes the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. The project combines serverless architecture and PWAs to provide benefits such as easy scalability, offline support, push notifications, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility. The TDD approach ensures high-quality code and adherence to requirements.
